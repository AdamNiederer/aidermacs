- Git repo specific aider session in emacs: automatically identify your git repo of current file, and create a new aider session for it. Multiple aider sessions can exist for different git repos.

- Region based refactor support: You can select a region in file and ask aider to refactor that.

- .. And more: add your own elisp function to support your use case. For sure you can ask aider / aider.el to do that.
