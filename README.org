#+TITLE: aider.el : aider (AI pair programming) inside emacs 

* Introduction
The Aider package provides an interactive interface to communicate with https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider.

* Installation
To install the Aider package, add the following to your Emacs configuration:

Using `use-package` with `straight`:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package 'aider)
#+END_SRC

You can also install the Aider package directly from MELPA by running the following command in Emacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'aider)
#+END_SRC

* Why use aider.el instead of command line?

- Automatically identify your git repo of current file, and create a new aider session for it. Multiple aider sessions can exist for different git repos.

- Pop-up menu. No need to remember the command.

- Region based refactor support. You can select a region in file and ask aider to refactor that.
