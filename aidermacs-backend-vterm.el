;;; Commentary:
;;
;; This file implements the VTerm backend for Aidermacs, providing
;; an interface for interacting with the Aider process within a
;; VTerm buffer. It leverages the VTerm package for a more
;; feature-rich terminal experience.
;;
;; Key features include:
;; - Integration with the VTerm package for terminal emulation.
;; - Asynchronous output processing using timers and advices.
;; - Custom keybindings for multi-line input.
;; - Management of the Aider process within a VTerm buffer.
;;
